            <p class="blog-content">After years of being at school, your first time at work be it an internship or a full-time role might be a little overwhelming as there's a complete shift in paradigm. My story was no different, I was clueless most of the time for the first few weeks but later figured it out with time. I had the opportunity to learn and grow so much in such a short span of time. Of all the things that I learnt here are the top 5 that I value the most.
